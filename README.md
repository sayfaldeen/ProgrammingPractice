# Programming Practice Repo

- This repo houses some code from my learning and practice attempts with programming concepts

- This repo is structured in a way that the simplest algorithms come first and act as lessons/examples
	1. ./n-sum.py [N integer sum problem]
	2. ./string-match.py [Number of matches between 2 strings]
	3. ./gcd.py [Find greatest common denominator]
	4. ./linear-search.py [Search through unordered list]
	5. ./binary-search.py [Search through ordered list]
