# Programming Practice Repo

- This repo houses some code from my learning and practice attempts with programming concepts

- This repo is structured in a way that the simplest algorithms come first and act as lessons/examples
	1. ./n-sum.py [N integer sum problem]
	2. ./string-match.py [Number of matches between 2 strings]
	3. ./gcd.py [Find greatest common denominator]
	4. ./linear-search.py [Search through unordered list]
	5. ./binary-search.py [Search through ordered list]
	6. ./quickselect.py [Find a specific k-order statistic within data]
	7. ./quicksort.py [Sort data using partition and recurse approach]

- There is also a few pieces of code here that work on implementing dynamic programming
	1. ./DP-Intro.ipynb [very basic intro to DP]
	2. ./DP-Fib.jl [Fibonacci in julia]
	3. ./DP-Fib.py [Fibonacci in python]
	4. ./Knapsack.ipynb [More detailed notebook demonstrating multiple DP solutions to Knapsack problem]

- ./PythonEfficiency.pdf [a PDF (and the markdown file it came from) that discusses code efficiency]
	- This file is very much in progress as much of what I have done has not been added yet
